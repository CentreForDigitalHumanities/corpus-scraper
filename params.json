{"name":"CorpusScraper","tagline":"Automated corpus data collection, offered to you by the Digital Humanities Lab","body":"# CorpusScraper version 1.0 #\r\n\r\nWelcome. CorpusScraper is a small script that you can run from your bookmarks bar (a “bookmarklet”). It extracts data from an online text corpus and lets you save the data to a CSV file, in just a few clicks.\r\n\r\n*Currently supported:*\r\n * [All corpuses from corpus.byu.edu](http://corpus.byu.edu/)\r\n * [Real Academia Española &ndash; CORDE](http://corpus.rae.es/cordenet.html)\r\n * [Real Academia Española &ndash; CREA](http://corpus.rae.es/creanet.html)\r\n\r\n## Installation ##\r\n\r\nDrag the box below to your bookmarks bar.  \r\n[ScrapeCorpus]()  \r\nGoogle Chrome is officially supported, but the bookmarklet should also work in Firefox and Safari.  \r\n*Note* The bookmarklet requires JavaScript in order to work.\r\n\r\n## Usage ##\r\n\r\nEnter a word-in-context query and load the first page of search results. When the page has completely loaded, click on the bookmarklet in your bookmarks bar. A progress bar is shown during extraction. After a while (about a second per page), the page turns white and a text box appears from which you can copy the CSV code (the text has already been selected for you). Paste the text into an empty plain text file (with e.g. Notepad, TextEdit or gedit) and save it with a .csv extension. Choose UTF-8 as the file encoding. The resulting file can be opened with Excel or SPSS. It uses semicolons to separate the values and double quotes to mark text values.\r\n\r\n&copy; 2014 Digital Humanities Lab, Faculty of Humanities, Utrecht University  \r\nAuthor: Julian Gonggrijp, j.gonggrijp@uu.nl\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
